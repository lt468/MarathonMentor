# MarathonMentor
A Web Application that is able to create a tailored Marathon training plan. This is my CS50w Final Project.

### Log of progress
As of 15/10/2023, I have decided to keep a log of what I am doing, what needs to be done, etc., for my own personal convenience. I hope to use this in the future
for documnetation.
